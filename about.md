### Our Goals

We are a group of people who have passion in the open source code community. Our goal for this service is to provide the greatest possible convenience to developers so that they don&rsquo;t have to set up a personal web server just to store and to showcase their projects online. We know that most open source project is built with a lack of financial support and is intended not to get any benefit financially. We try to help you with that, so you can focus only on the development process.

### Our Network

<div class="my-3" id="network-graph">
  <div>Sisipkan grafik di sini&hellip;</div>
</div>

Statically is dedicated to running on multiple servers like {% include every.html k='data_centers' %}. It comes with a modern platform that is compatible with HTTP/2.0 and HTTPS. We will use _Brotli_ if your browser accepts it and we will send your request through the nearest data center.

We have 10 data centers located in strategic locations + {{ site.data_centers.size }} CDN providers that help with the performance of our platform. Check our statistic usage [here](https://statically.io/stats).

### Supported Providers

Statically can serves **raw files** from these providers with proper `Content-Type` headers and makes it faster for you:

 - GitHub
 - GitLab
 - Bitbucket
 - WordPress SVN

### Cache Behavior

There are two versions of Statically: **Production and Development**. Below you will learn how to use Statically as a Production CDN and Development CDN.

*   **Production CDN**

    By default, Statically Raw Files CDN cache are set to **1 year** via `Cache-Control` header for every files except on the **master** branch, we set cache for **master** branch **for 24 hours** so new changes you push to GitHub will be reflected within this time.

    But if you want to use Statically as a **Development CDN** you can add query string `?env=dev` to tell CDN to not cache your files, you can learn more at Development CDN section below.

    The CDN caches files based on their permanent URL.

    Example:

    * GitHub [https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js)
    * Imgpx [https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/9usQKZg.jpg](https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/9usQKZg.jpg)

*   **Development CDN** `?env=dev`

    You can use Statically as a Development CDN, it means Statically CDN will not cache files, new changes you push to GitHub will be reflected within minutes. Development CDN will works when you set up `?env=dev` query string on the URL.

    Example:

    * [https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js?env=dev](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js?env=dev)
